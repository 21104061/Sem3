Ans1 # Function to print nodes in a given Circular linked list

    temp = self.head 

    # If linked list is not empty 
    if self.head is not None: 
        while(True): 

            # Print nodes till we reach first node again 
            print(temp.data, end=" ") 
            temp = temp.next
            if (temp == self.head): 
                break

Ans2. Circular Linked Lists can be used to manage the computing resources of the computer.
Data structures such as stacks and queues are implemented with the help of the circular linked lists.
Circular Linked List is also used in the implementation of advanced data structures such as a Fibonacci Heap.
It is also used in computer networking for token scheduling.
Round Robin scheduling technique in games.
